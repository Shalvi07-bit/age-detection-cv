# Age and Gender Detection Using OpenCV

##Description
This project detects human faces from a webcam feed and predicts **age** and **gender** using a deep learning model.  
It utilizes **OpenCV's deep learning module (`cv2.dnn`)** with pre-trained models for face detection, age classification, and gender classification.

---

#Features
- Real-time **face detection** using OpenCV's Deep Neural Network (DNN) module.
- Predicts **age group** from predefined categories.
- Predicts **gender** (Male/Female).
- Uses **pre-trained Caffe models** for accuracy.
- Press **'q'** to exit the application.

#Installation Guide
### Install Dependencies
Ensure **Python 3.x** is installed, then install the required libraries using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
